# Sales Trend Analysis â€“ SQL Project
# About the Project
This project demonstrates how to analyze sales trends using SQL on a cleaned dataset. The dataset represents online sales transactions with details like order ID, date, amount, and product information. Through SQL queries, we uncover key business insights such as monthly revenue trends, top-performing months, and total orders.

# Dataset
-The dataset used is sample_online_sales.csv, containing the following columns:
-order_id: Unique identifier for each order
-order_date: Date of transaction
-amount: Revenue generated from the order
-product_id: Unique product identifier

 All records are from the year 2023 and are sample entries created for educational purposes.

# Technologies Used
